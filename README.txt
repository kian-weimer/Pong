How to Play:
	This game is a variation of the traditional pong game.
	There are both solo and multiplayer options which can be selected from the main menu.
	Solo:
		The player controls the right paddle with the up and down arrow keys. The left paddle is a CPU which the player will play against.
	Multiplayer:
		Two players control the right and left paddles.
		The left paddle is controled by the 'w' and 's' keys while the right paddle is controlled by the up and down arrow keys.
	The goal of the game is to score goals against your opponent. This is done by getting the ball past the opponent's paddle.
	The first player to get 5 goals wins the match.

	Additional Features:
		The ball speeds up after every paddle hit. Once a goal is scored, the paddle resets to its initial speed.
		Powerups will spawn every 10-30 seconds.
		They are activated immediately when the ball makes contact with them.
		Three powerups are available which affect speed, direction, and quantity.

Art Aspects:
	We went for a simplistic, Neon design. We changed the color of the paddles, text, and 
		balls to a blueish teal and made the menu buttons a darker blue. The background was also changed to black.
	We slimmed up the paddles and ball to make for a more modern gaming experiance and created new icons to represent the 
		various powerups. 

Sound:
	All sounds were created using the BeepBox online sound editor.
	Sound was implemented in a variety of locations throughout the game to give the players a more emmersive experience. 
	Background music was created. This music speeds slightly up when playing to represent the increasing speed of the ball.
		The music also resets to its standard speed after each goal is made.
	A countdown timer noise was created for the begining of each round.
	A extra beed along with some audiance cheering occurs after each goal is scored.
	A small beep occurs after a power up is picked up.
	Different clicks are made when the ball hits the wall and paddle.


Data tracking:
	The Score and game counter are constantly displayed throughout the game.
	Additional statistics can be displayed by pressing 'i'.
	These include thew number of hits in the round, the total number of hits, the total number of hits for each person, 
	The time elapsed for the entire match, the longest round, each players current win streak(one will always be zero),
	and the longest win streak. 
	These statistics are reset after each match, but can be reset sooner by clicking the reset statistic button within the 
	extra statistics menu. Note: this does not reset the toal round timer or the game score.

	A new game can be started by either clicking the home button (top left) and starting a new game or by 
	clicking the restart button (top right).
	The player(s) may reset the statistics by either starting a new game or clicking the 'reset statistics' button 
	within the extra statistics menu.
	The player can quit the game by clicking the home button to go back to the main menu or the 'x' on the top right of the 
	window to exit the game entirely.
	There is also an 'X' in the main menu which can be used to quit the application.
